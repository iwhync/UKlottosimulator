Curious about the actual odds of winning the lotto?
Realistic Lottery Simulator!
You will be assigned 6 random numbers between 1 - 59.
These will remain static.
Numbers will then be drawn over and over until both your numbers, and the drawn numbers are an exact match
You will then be informed of how many attempts this had taken, and the accumulative cost
Expect this to take a while. Probably like, 10 minutes? Unless you're very lucky!!
Well - in practice I find it takes around 10 minutes, however, given it is random, or as random as sudo random can be, while statistically unlikely it could run forever without matching all numbers.
